The company requires a traditional finance rebuild, separation of business lines, and cost reduction to return to profitability. A new CEO is needed to lead the 2-3 year turnaround effort, with a traditional employment agreement. Industry experience is not necessary, as the company's challenges are more related to retail operations. Key objectives include selling off excess inventory and resizing the company's footprint to achieve significant upside potential.
